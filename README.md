In the paper *Configurations of points and topology of real line arrangements*, Math. Ann. 374 (2019), no. 1-2, 1–35, <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00208-018-1673-0">`doi`: 10.1007/s00208-018-1673-0</a>, B. Guerville and J. Viu give families of line arrangements which define Zariski pairs distinguished by a link invariant. This paper can be found also in <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1702.00922"> <kbd>arXiv:1702.00922</kbd></a>. Moreover, a simple way to compute this linking invariant is given. 

In a subsequent paper, *Fundamental groups of real arrangements and torsion in the lower central series quotients", Exp. Math. 29 (2020), no. 1, 28–35,
<a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10586458.2018.1428131"> `doi`: 10.1080/10586458.2018.1428131</a>, these authors together with E. Artal compute the fundamental groups for one of these pairs and prove they are not isomorphic. This paper can also be found in <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.04152"> <kbd>arXiv:1704.04152</kbd></a>). 

We provide two notebooks for the involved computations, which can be downloaded. The `gap` notebooks have no comments. The `Sagemath` can be executed online in [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/enriqueartal/GuervilleViuZariskiPairs/master).
